A kit (6x Mi models) with fixed parameters.

- Compile: =make all=

- Start: =make start=

- Connect: =make connect=

- Clean the binaries: =make clean=

** Jack-snapshots
You need to connect the midi inputs of the model to whatever midi source you are using.
We recomand to use qjactl patchbay to make those connections. 
Then you can run
#+begin_src bash
 aj-snapshot jack-snapshots/filename
#+end_src
to save a patchbay configuration.
and
#+begin_src bash
 aj-snapshot -r jack-snapshots/filename
#+end_src
to restore the connections.
