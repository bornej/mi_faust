A kit (6x Mi models) with fixed parameters.

- Compile: =make all=

- Start: =make start=

- Connect: =make connect=

- Clean the binaries: =make clean=

** Jack-snapshots
You need to connect the midi inputs of the model to whatever midi source you are using.
We recommend using qjactl patchbay. 
Then you can run
#+begin_src bash
 aj-snapshot jack-snapshots/filename
#+end_src
to save a patchbay configuration.
and
#+begin_src bash
 aj-snapshot -r jack-snapshots/filename
#+end_src
to restore the connections.
