* Terminology:
 - Model: The physical model used for sound synthesis in the faust.dsp program.
 - Parameters: Our physical models have three or four parameters
    M:mass, K:Damper: Z:stiffness, Z_osc:Internal Damping (optionnal)
 - ND: Nord Drum
 - Voices: The ND has six voices (one voice per pad).
     Our goal is to assign one Faust Model per voice.
 - Focused voice: On the ND, the voice we are currently editing.
 - Listening voice: The model will receive midi control values 
   when this voice has the focus on the ND.

* Introduction
The models in this folder represent small percusive instruments
designed to be played with the clavia nord 3p.
User are free to assign those models to the 6 ND voices.
The model parameter can be controlled directly from the ND
front panel via MIDI Control Change messages.

* Setup
** Nord drum
Set voice 1 to note 1, voice 2 to note 2, ..., voice 6 to note 6.

** Models
Set =listeningVoice= to the ND voice of your choice.
ex: To assign a model to voice/pad 1 set listeningvoice=1.

* Midi control implementation 
** How the ND handles Midi CC

Idealy we would want
All the voice-1 Control Changes on channel 1
All the voice-2 CC on channel 2
 ...
All the voice-6 CC on channel 6

Unfortunatelly, the nord drum sends all outgoing 
CC values to a single Channel (global channel).
So our models can't use midi channels to filter out CC informations
comming from the different ND voices. 
We need a way to know which ND voice has the focus.
A model will only listen to incoming MIDI-CC messages when the focus
is on the right ND voice. 

** Implementation:
Let's say we expect our model to receive values from ND voice 1
#+begin_src faust
listeningVoice = 1;
#+end_src

We listen to CC70 (select voice) values to know which voice is currently focused.
 |-----------+---------------|
 | CC 70 val | focused voice |
 |-----------+---------------|
 |         0 |             1 |
 |        26 |             2 |
 |        51 |             3 |
 |        77 |             4 |
 |       102 |             5 |
 |       127 |             6 |
 |-----------+---------------|

#+begin_src faust
cc70 = nentry("cc70[midi:ctrl 70][hidden:1]", 26, 0, 127, 1);
voice_selector(s) = *(s==0),*(s==26),*(s==51),*(s==77),*(s==102),*(s==127) :> _;
focusedVoice = 1,2,3,4,5,6 :  voice_selector(cc70) :hbargraph("focusedVoice",1,6);
#+end_src

Then if the focus is on the right voice we listen to incomming MIDI-CC messages.
#+begin_src faust
focus = (listeningVoice == focusedVoice);
#+end_src

** TODO Need to check which track has focus on startup
For the moment we need to touch the "ch-select" buttons for
the control to start.
