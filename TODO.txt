MI FAUST / TODO


**********************************************

Model initialisation: for recursive letrecs, the delayed position ' variables seem to be set to 0.
They should be set to the delayed position of the masses connected to them !


----


NLBOW interaction doesn't seem to be working properly


-----


Force input to model: add a module or a simple mechanism to do this (could be a signal connected straight to a mass)
Should work exactly the same as a regular mass, by only adding the signal to the routing

-----

Audio rate parameters inside the model: already in the faust logic
Integrate into MIMS generator so that an audioRateParam is generated in Faust just like a regular param.


------

Demo models to create:
	
	basic oscillator / percussion model ("miHelloMass")
	Basic MIDI control (implicit polyphony mechanism with a simple model)
	plucked string (with harmonics and/or fret mechanisms)
	bowed string
	membrane or irregular topology (for complex routing tables)
	physical resonator responding to audio input.
	"slow" physical model to control other audio DSP processes (AM, FM...?)
